# Introduction
The project aims to use machine learning to identify EEG signals to warn drowsy drivers against losing concentration. 
The problem affects road safety, and the analyzes carried out are an important source of data for business.

# Other uses

Monitoring Professional Drivers: Transportation companies can install EEG systems in trucks or buses to monitor the drivers' state in real-time and prevent accidents caused by fatigue.
Insurance: Insurance companies could offer lower rates to drivers using EEG monitoring systems as a safety-enhancing mechanism.
Autonomous Cars: In the context of emerging autonomous vehicle technologies, these systems can serve as an additional condition for switching between manual and autonomous modes.
Mobile Apps: Companies can develop mobile applications that work in conjunction with portable EEG devices to inform drivers of their condition and suggest driving breaks.
Consumer Products: For individual drivers, portable EEG devices can be offered as an add-on to existing in-car navigation and safety systems.
Marketing and Advertising: Companies can use positive research outcomes and statistics related to EEG technology as a marketing tool.
Personalized Driving Experience: Based on EEG data, in-car systems can adjust settings (e.g., air conditioning, music) to help the driver maintain an optimal level of attention.
