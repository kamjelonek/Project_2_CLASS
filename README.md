# Binary Classification of Drowsy Drivers' EEG Waves

## Introduction
The project aims to use machine learning to identify EEG signals to warn drowsy drivers against losing concentration. The problem affects road safety, and the analyses carried out provide a crucial source of data for businesses.

## Description of Features
- **Attention** - Proprietary measure of mental focus from 0-100 
- **Meditation** - Proprietary measure of calmness from 0-100 
- **Delta** - 1-3 Hz of power spectrum 
- **Theta** - 4-7 Hz of power spectrum 
- **LowAlpha** - Lower 8-11 Hz of power spectrum 
- **HighAlpha** - Higher 8-11 Hz of power spectrum 
- **LowBeta** - Lower 12-29 Hz of power spectrum 
- **HighBeta** - Higher 12-29 Hz of power spectrum 
- **LowGamma** - Lower 30-100 Hz of power spectrum 
- **HighGamma** - Higher 30-100 Hz of power spectrum 
- **Classification** - (0-drowsy/1-awake)

## Business Applications
### Monitoring Professional Drivers
Transportation companies can install EEG systems in trucks or buses to monitor the drivers' state in real-time and prevent accidents caused by fatigue.

### Insurance
Insurance companies could offer lower rates to drivers using EEG monitoring systems as a safety-enhancing mechanism.

### Autonomous Cars
In the context of emerging autonomous vehicle technologies, these systems can serve as an additional condition for switching between manual and autonomous modes.

### Mobile Apps
Companies can develop mobile applications that work in conjunction with portable EEG devices to inform drivers of their condition and suggest driving breaks.

### Consumer Products
For individual drivers, portable EEG devices can be offered as an add-on to existing in-car navigation and safety systems.

### Marketing and Advertising
Companies can use positive research outcomes and statistics related to EEG technology as a marketing tool.

### Personalized Driving Experience
Based on EEG data, in-car systems can adjust settings (e.g., air conditioning, music) to help the driver maintain an optimal level of attention.
